  <description>Open World is a work in progress mod that aims to achieve a fun and natural multiplayer experience in Rimworld. With it, you can experience all your normal and casual adventures that you would in a singleplayer, but now connected with a bunch of other players living the same as you do.

You can choose to help each other by providing support, or to transform into a world wide known enemy for all the players of the planet. There are no rules but the ones you dictate yourself.

To connect to a server, use the multiplayer buttons when creating or loading a world. All data sent between clients of this mod and server is encrypted using simple but working encryption.

Attention! This is a work in progress mod! Things are prone to breaking!
